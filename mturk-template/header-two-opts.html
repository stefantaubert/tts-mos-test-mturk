      <b>IMPORTANT:</b> do NOT work on this HIT without carefully reading the instructions first, even if you have
      worked
      on our HITs in the past, as instructions often change between experiments.

          Your task is to evaluate the quality of the speech from eight short (4-7 second) audio files. This task typically
          requires approximately 90 seconds to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the number and quality of the answers you submit, we pay different <b>bonuses</b>, which can
          result
          in a total of <b>$0.60/HIT</b> (approx. $24/hour).
        </p>
      </short-summary>

      <detailed-instructions>
        <p>
          You will hear samples of computer generated speech created using different methods. The purpose of this test
          is
          to evaluate the quality of each file, so that we (the researchers) can compare the methods and know which ones
          sound better to a general audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each file should be given a score according to the following scale, known as the MOS (mean opinion score)
          scale
          for naturalness:
        </p>
        <table>

        <h3>Examples</h3>

        <p>The following references illustrate the meaning of each score. Please note that you will encounter many other
          types of distorted or unnatural speech. Therefore, these examples do not exhaust the range of conditions you
          can
          expect to hear.</p>

        <p>The following represents clean speech from a human male, and is given a reference score of <b>5</b>:</p>
        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" style="width: 400px">

          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>

        <p>The following is synthesized speech with a reference score of <b>4</b>:</p>

        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" style="width: 400px">
          <source src="https://tuc.cloud/index.php/s/K4FCMbTxg6bHGDy/download?path=/mos-4.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>

        <p>This file has synthesized speech with a reference score of <b>3</b>:</p>

        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" style="width: 400px">
          <source src="https://tuc.cloud/index.php/s/K4FCMbTxg6bHGDy/download?path=/mos-3.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>

        <p>This file has synthesized speech with a reference score of <b>2</b>:</p>

        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" style="width: 400px">
          <source src="https://tuc.cloud/index.php/s/K4FCMbTxg6bHGDy/download?path=/mos-2.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />
          Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>

        <p>
          Finally, this has synthesized speech with a reference score of <b>1.3</b>:</p>

        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload" style="width: 400px">
          <source src="https://tuc.cloud/index.php/s/K4FCMbTxg6bHGDy/download?path=/mos-1.3.wav" type="audio/mpeg" />

        </audio>

        <p>Please keep in mind that speech can be unnatural in many ways, and these are only specific examples.</p>

        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>We have methods that analyze the consistency of your answers with respect to themselves, to those of your
          fellow workers and to references we know to be accurate. We will use these methods to rank the submitted
          assignments according to quality.
        <p>For this experiment we will pay a base reward of $0.10/HIT for every accepted HIT. We have made available a
          set
          of 60 different HITs. You will receive a bonus of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$0.10/HIT (for a total of $0.20/HIT) if you submit 20 or more HITs or</li>
          <li>$0.30/HIT (for a total of $0.40/HIT) if you submit 20 or more HITs and your results are among the top 50%
            or
          </li>
          <li>$0.50/HIT (for a total of $0.60/HIT) if you submit 20 or more HITs and your results are among the top 10%.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bonuses will be paid up to 7 days after submission, because we can only rank the submissions once we have a
          statistically significant number of answers. The base reward will always be paid within 24 hours of
          submission.
        </p>

        <h3>Approval/Rejection Policy</h3>
        <p>To obtain accurate results, we strongly recommend that you wear headphones and work in a quiet environment,
          otherwise you might not be able to discriminate between files with clearly different features. Our experience
          shows that it is very difficult to land in the top 50% or top 10% and get a bonus for quality without wearing
          headphones.</p>
        <p>Your results will be collected and evaluated for consistency. We (the requesters) have an estimate of each
          file's subjective quality that conforms with the references above. Thus, we can detect if someone submits
          random
          scores or does not rate according to these instructions, which can lead to work being rejected. You can rest
          assured that your work will be approved if you rate according to the instructions above.</p>
        <p>Answers will be either reviewed or automatically approved within 24 hours.</p>
